# Type to remember

A fun interactive type-racer to help users remember texts by typing them!

## Motivation for the project :3
- Wanted to build a fun project on my own, from start to finish
- Had ideas how type racer worked under the hood, wanted to implement it myself.
- Needed to learn latex and fun little math facts for calculus and proofs course
- Wanted to learn how react hooks really worked, nothing better than a hands-on experience

You can view the project at: https://typetoremember.vercel.app/

## Whats next
- include latex preview (to see how the latex commands render in real time)
- more statistic graphs, maybe incoporate some AI to analyze data collected.
- redo design and revamp the UI
- allow users to add text from UI rather from manually adding to files
